# Exercise 2: Using the multiprocessing module, write a simple python program as follows:

# Create a pool of workers to run parallel tasks.
# The pool size should be 2.
# Write a function to be running in parallel, call it print_cube. 
# The function should receive as input a number [num]. When called, 
# the function will print to the screen a message in the form: 
#     “The cube of number [num] is [cube]”. Where [cube] should be replaced with the cube of the number received as input.

# Write a function to be running in parallel, call it print_square. 
# The function should receive as input a number [num]. When called, 
# the function will print to the screen a message in the form: 
#     “The square of number [num] is [square]”. Where [square] should be replaced with the square of the number received as input.
