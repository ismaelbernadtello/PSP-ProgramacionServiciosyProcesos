# Exercise 2: Using the multithreading module, write a python program as follows:
# ● Create a pool of threads to run concurrent tasks.
# ● The pool size should be 3.
# ● Create and fill an array of 100 random integer numbers.
# ● Run all 3 threads to parse the vector data. One of them must show the mean, another
#   the maximum and minimum value, and the last one the standard deviation. Note that
#   although these processes share the vector, they only do so for reading. None of them
#   must modify any value of the vector.
