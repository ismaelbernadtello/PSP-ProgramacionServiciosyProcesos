# Exercise 1: Using the multithreading module, write a simple python program as follows:
# ● Create a pool of threads to run concurrent tasks.
# ● The pool size should be 10.
# ● The thread should receive as input a number [id] (unique identifier for each of the
#   threads, starting from 1) and a number [number_of_writtings] (number of times the
#   thread will write the message).
# ● Each thread should sleep a random amount of time (between 100 and 300
#   milliseconds) and write the message ("I am 1", "I am 2", etc) a random number of times
#   between 5 and 15.
